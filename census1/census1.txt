      Median and Percentage Data M1-40
      As computed from STF1 Source Data by Databasics.
      Almost all values are ratios expressed as percentages.  For example, to compute the data item
      or variable M10 "Percent Hispanic" the numerator is the number of persons of Hispanic origin in
      the block group.  The denominator is the total population of the block group.  Some
      numerators or denominators involve aggregates of finer Census data.  For example, we must
      add together 13 age categories to obtain  M1, a total for ages 0-18.
